- ### Subscription Management
  A dedicated subscription page presents various pricing plans for customers who wish to subscribe to specific services or meal plans. Administrators can update these prices and subscription details from the backend. Customers can fill out a subscription form to enroll, ensuring a smooth sign-up process.

- ### Shopping Cart and Checkout
  Customers can add items to a shopping cart as they browse the menu. The cart provides a clear view of selected items, including quantities and total cost.
The checkout page allows users to review their order details and proceed to place the order. While it does not currently include a payment gateway, the checkout system is designed to handle order processing, making it easy for administrators to manage orders manually.

- ### Backend for Administrators
  The backend includes a comprehensive dashboard that provides an overview of key metrics and activity, such as total sales, new orders, and active subscriptions.
Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities are implemented for managing menu items, subscriptions, and customer orders. Administrators can seamlessly manage content, view customer details, and handle operations, ensuring smooth restaurant management.
