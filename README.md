# Fuel Food - Restaurant Management Application

Fuel Food is a comprehensive restaurant management web application built using Laravel, leveraging the powerful Laravel Volt and Jetstream packages. It combines an elegant frontend design with robust backend functionality, providing a seamless experience for both customers and administrators.

## Key Features
- ### Home Page
  The homepage is designed to captivate visitors with a visually appealing layout and smooth animations, powered by Alpine.js. It highlights the restaurant's offerings, with interactive elements that enhance user engagement.

- ### Dynamic Menu Page
  The menu page showcases all the dishes offered by Fuel Food, neatly organized in different sections using Alpine.js for easy browsing. The menu can be fully managed from the backend, allowing administrators to add, update, or remove items effortlessly. Each menu item can include details like name, description, price, and image, making it easy for customers to explore what the restaurant has to offer.

- ### Subscription Management
  A dedicated subscription page presents various pricing plans for customers who wish to subscribe to specific services or meal plans. Administrators can update these prices and subscription details from the backend. Customers can fill out a subscription form to enroll, ensuring a smooth sign-up process.

- ### Shopping Cart and Checkout
  Customers can add items to a shopping cart as they browse the menu. The cart provides a clear view of selected items, including quantities and total cost.
The checkout page allows users to review their order details and proceed to place the order. While it does not currently include a payment gateway, the checkout system is designed to handle order processing, making it easy for administrators to manage orders manually.

- ### Backend for Administrators
  The backend includes a comprehensive dashboard that provides an overview of key metrics and activity, such as total sales, new orders, and active subscriptions.
Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities are implemented for managing menu items, subscriptions, and customer orders. Administrators can seamlessly manage content, view customer details, and handle operations, ensuring smooth restaurant management.
